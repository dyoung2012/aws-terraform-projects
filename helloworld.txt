Hello World,

My name a Darrell!

Weclome to the Zombie Apocalypse!

I'm learning Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) and created a simple project.
More will be on the way as I continue to learn and explore what Terraform has offer.
I will be leveraging Terraform with AWS, Azure, GCP, and Digital Ocean later in this process.
Thanks for the support and Happy Coding and Hello World!

Remember that we are all in this together and no one person is never alone.
